Synopsis

The humpty "man page"::

  $ humpty --help
  Usage: humpty [OPTIONS] WHEELS...

    Convert wheels to eggs.

  Options:
    -d, --dist-dir DIR  Build eggs into <dir>.  Default is <cwd>/dist.

Suppose you need an egg of a distribution which has only been uploaded
to PyPI as a wheel::

  $ pip install --download . publicsuffixlist
  [...]
    Saved ./publicsuffixlist-0.2.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl
  Successfully downloaded publicsuffixlist

  $ humpty -dist-dir . publicsuffixlist-0.2.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl
  Converting publicsuffixlist-0.2.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl to publicsuffixlist-0.2.8-py2.6.egg

  $ easy_install publicsuffixlist-0.2.8-py2.7.egg
